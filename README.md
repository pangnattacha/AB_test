# Project: Analyze A/B test results

## Introduction
A/B test is a statistical process to compare two viriants **A** and **B** whether which one performs better to improve the output. Oftentimes, A/B testing is employed to measure changes of new version website or application from old version to help the company making decision to keep the old version or go on with the new one.

## Objective
This project aimed to analyze the results of A/B test run by an e-commerce website for the company to understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Methodology
### Techonologies used
- Jupyter notebook (Python)
- Python libraries: Numpy, Pandas, random, Matplotlib, statsmodel, sklearn
### Methodologies
- Probability
- A/B test
- Regression

## Key finding
